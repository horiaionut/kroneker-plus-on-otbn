# Kroneker+ implementation on the OpenTitan Big Number Accelerator

Master thesis in informatics that tackles the issue of repurposing old processors dedicated for classical cryptographic computations for the new quantum-resistent cryptography schemes. The implemented algorithm, namely Kroneker+, is a recent highly efficient method of doing polynomial multiplication via large integer multiplication. It changes the Nussbaumer's method and makes use of Kroneker substitution and Number Theoretic Transform.
