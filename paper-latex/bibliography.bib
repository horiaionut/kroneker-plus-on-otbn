	abstract = {Over the last years lattice-based cryptography has received much attention due to versatile average-case problems like Ring-LWE or Ring-SIS that appear to be intractable by quantum computers. But despite of promising constructions, only few results have been published on implementation issues on very constrained platforms. In this work we therefore study and compare implementations of Ring-LWE encryption and the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) on an 8-bit Atmel ATxmega128 microcontroller. Since the number theoretic transform (NTT) is one of the core components in implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems, we review the application of the NTT in previous implementations and present an improved approach that significantly lowers the runtime for polynomial multiplication. Our implementation of Ring-LWE encryption takes 27 ms for encryption and 6.7 ms for decryption. To compute a BLISS signature, our software takes 329 ms and 88 ms for verification. These results outperform implementations on similar platforms and underline the feasibility of lattice-based cryptography on constrained devices.},

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

This algorithm is divided into three components: key generation, signature generation, and signature verification. We select three variants of FALCON with distinct security strength and make these variants capable of synthesis by a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We summarize all the changes in the C code to make it capable of synthesis. Using HLS, we generate FPGA and ASIC designs for signature verification of three variants. For FALCON hardware architectures, we evaluate trade-offs in power, area, speed, and security parameters. We explore the design-space through a detailed analysis of FPGA and ASIC designs for FALCON, concluding that for the FPGA implementation, latency increases with security while for the ASIC-specific implementation, loop pipelining improves the latency without any additional memory or area cost.},

Here a new method is presented, based upon long integer multiplication, by which even faster algorithms can be obtained. Under reasonable assumptions (like ℓ≥log(n+1), and on the coefficient size) polynomial multiplication and discrete Fourier transforms of length n and in ℓ-bit precision are possible in time O($\psi$ (nℓ)), and division of polynomials in O($\psi$(n(ℓ+n))).

In this work, we provide an efficient implementation of Saber on ESP32, an embedded microcontroller designed for IoT environment with WiFi and Bluetooth support. RSA coprocessor was used to speed up the polynomial multiplications for Kyber variant in a CHES 2019 paper. We propose an improved implementation utilizing the big integer coprocessor for the polynomial multiplications in Saber, which contains significant lower software overhead and takes a better advantage of the big integer coprocessor on ESP32. By using the fast implementation of polynomial multiplications, our single-core version implementation of Saber takes 1639K, 2123K, 2193K clock cycles on ESP32 for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively. Benefiting from the dual core feature on ESP32, we speed up the implementation of Saber by rearranging the computing steps and assigning proper tasks to two cores executing in parallel. Our dual-core version implementation takes 1176K, 1625K, 1514K clock cycles for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively.},
